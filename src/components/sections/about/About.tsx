                    I have a background in Information Technology and a strong interest in frontend development for both
                    web and mobile platforms. With an educational foundation in technology and experience in small to
                    high-scale projects, both personal and team-based. I enjoy the challenge of turning designs into
                    functional and responsive code, while ensuring that users feel comfortable and at ease when using
                    the websites or applications I create.
